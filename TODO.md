# TODO

+ Have separate sliders for Hue(H), Saturation(S) and Value(V)

  + Attach an identifier character at the end to distinguish b/w different values Eg. 14H would be a value of 14 for Hue

+ Allow baudrate customization (possibly through Menu bar)

+ COM Port Selection

+ Custom / Default Presets (Menu Bar)

+ Slider value is only sent when a button is pressed
